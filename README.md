# lightning_detector

Detects lightning from video files.

The `ffmpeg_avicon` script will attempt to convert your video into something the python script can work with.

You will have to install ffmpeg, and the ffmpeg script assumes linux/*nix.

Work in progress.

Usage: 
```bash
# To run the code:
python lightning.py GP040259.MP4.avi

# To see options:
python lightning.py -h

```
